				<p>
          <b>1. What dialect does FCS teach?</b><br><br>
          FCS teaches Mandarine.<br><br>
          <b>2. When does the FCS semester start and end?</b><br><br>
          FCS follows the Folsom Cordova School District school calendar.
          You may refer to FCS school schedule for the detailed class dates.<br><br>
          <b>3. How much does it cost to attend?</b><br><br>
          FCS is a non-profit organization, but we ask for a mandatory donation of $170 for the 15 weeks class per child.
          Additional children from the same family registered for the same semester will receive a $10 discount.
          FCS does not charge a registration fee.  Receipts will only be provided upon request at the end of January for tax filing purposes.<br><br>
          <b>4. How many classes does FCS offer?</b><br><br>
          We offer 10 classes ranging from kindergarten to 5th grade, including CSL
          - Chinese as a Second Language 1st through 4th grades.<br><br>
          <b>5. Does FCS have Chinese class for adults?</b><br><br>
          Yes, we do. The tuition is $250. The class opens to the general public.
          It's a small class size focusing on Mandarin conversations.
          We emphasize learning through exercises, games and interaction.<br><br>
          <b>6. Can I register my child in the middle of the semester?</b><br><br>
          Only transfer students are accepted during the middle of the school semesters.
          A placement test will be given to the student for the appropriated class level enrollment.<br><br>
          <b>7. Do you accept families with no Chinese Background?</b><br><br>
          Yes, FCS is open to everyone.<br><br>
          <b>8. Why adopt <b>Ni Hao</b>? The textbook and workbook cost money.</b><br><br>
          <b>Ni Hao</b> is designed in two written versions - Traditional and Simplified, which meets all students’ and parents’ need.
          The content includes both areas of the Chinese Language and Culture. The contents and themes in the books are more applicable to our daily life in the United States.
          Plus, many schools in the U.S. have adopted <b>Ni Hao</b>. <br><br>One of FCS goals is to help academic oriented students prepare to continue their learning Chinese in the high schools/colleges,
          and possibly take the SAT II Chinese and AP Chinese tests into their consideration.
          Our teachers not only use <b>Ni Hao</b>, but will also include other supplements in their teaching in order to meet the requirements of the four areas (listening, speaking, reading and writing).<br><br>
          <b>9. How much are the books?</b><br><br>
          The costs of the textbooks and workbooks range from $70 to $100.
          In general, higher grade level text books cost more.
          FCS reserves the right to change this price to cover the costs.<br><br>
          <b>10. Can I get a refund if my child no longer wants to attend FCS?</b><br><br>
          A student is allowed a 2-week grace period for class trial.
          Within the grace period and a written notice, refunds are provided deducting a $20 processing fee.
          No fees will be refunded after the third week of attending FCS.<br><br>
          <b>11. Does FCS require parent volunteers?</b><br><br>
          Yes. To provide a save and clean environment for our school,
          all parents are required to participate in the rotational mandatory
          "Floor Monitor" duties. Upon your child's enrollment, your duty date(s) will be scheduled and posted on the Volunteer Schedule web page early during the semester.
          Please check your duty date(s) and mark it on your calendar.  On your duty day(s), please:

          <ul>
          <li>Arrive at school 5 minutes early before class starts and sign in at the office</li>
          <li>Direct students to their classrooms</li>
          <li>Guard campus during recess and make sure no kids getting out of school</li>
          <li>Sign out at the office after school </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          If you are unable to serve on your scheduled date,
          you may pay the $20 fee for us to find a high school student to take your place or swap with another parent and let us know of your swap dates. Please e-mail FCS about the changes.

          <br><br>FCS board also appreciates your help on other volunteer opportunities when needed.<br><br>
